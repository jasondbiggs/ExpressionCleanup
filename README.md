# ExpressionCleanup

This package exports one function, `Cleanup[expr, func]` which will call `func` when all references to `expr` are gone. `Cleanup[expr]` will call any cleanup code that has been registered for `expr`, and `Cleanup[]` will call all registered cleanup code.  All cleanup code is called when the kernel exits cleanly.

Note that 'references' includes anything in the output history, anything accessible via `%` or `Out[..]`.  In the example below, `$HistoryLength` is set to zero otherwise `Out[4]` would have kept the expression still available.



```
In[2]:= << ExpressionCleanup`

In[3]:= $HistoryLength = 0

Out[3]= 0

In[4]:= f = {1, 2, 3}

Out[4]= {1, 2, 3}

In[5]:= Cleanup[f,
 Print["calling deletion code"];
 Print["use any compound expression"];
 ]

In[6]:= f =.
